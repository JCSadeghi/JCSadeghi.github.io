I am currently a PhD Student at the [Institute for Risk and Uncertainty](http://riskinstitute.uk) at the University of Liverpool. Previously I studied for an MPhys in Theoretical Physics at the University of Manchester.

My current research intersects the disciplines of Machine Learning, Nuclear Engineering, Software Engineering and Uncertainty Quantification. I am particularly interested in rigorously quantifying the uncertainty introduced by applying Machine Learning techniques in the field of Engineering (especially surrogate models, which are often themselves introduced to help quantify uncertainty). I am also interested in understanding the data efficiency and computational efficiency of surrogate models. During my time at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty I have contributed to the development of the open source generalised uncertainty quantification software, [OpenCossan](http://www.cossan.co.uk).
