I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at FiveAI.
Previously I was a PhD Student at the University of Liverpool, supervised by [Marco de Angelis](https://marcodeangelis.github.io) and [Edoardo Patelli](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/engineering/staff/edoardo-patelli/).
Before that, I gained an MPhys in Theoretical Physics at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

### Research interests
- Machine Learning, particularly for approximation of computer codes
- Uncertainty Quantification
- Interval Mathematics
- Imprecise Probability
- Robust Bayesian Inference
- Reliability Theory

During my time at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty I contributed to the development of the open source generalised uncertainty quantification software, [OpenCossan](http://www.cossan.co.uk).

You can read an ebook based on my PhD thesis [here](https://uncertainty-for-engineers.github.io/uncertainty-modelling-for-engineers).
