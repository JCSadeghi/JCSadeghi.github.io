I am currently working at a startup, building something new at the intersection of AI and computer graphics.
Previously, I was a Senior Research Engineer at Bosch (formerly [FiveAI](https://www.five.ai/)).
Before that, I was a PhD Student at the University of Liverpool, supervised by [Marco de Angelis](https://marcodeangelis.github.io) and [Edoardo Patelli](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/patelliedoardoprofessor/).
As an undergraduate I read Theoretical Physics at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/).

### Research interests
- Machine Learning
- Computer Vision
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Surrogate Models
- Uncertainty Quantification

During my time at the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty I contributed to the development of the open source generalised uncertainty quantification software, [OpenCossan](https://github.com/cossan-working-group/OpenCossan).

You can read an ebook based on my PhD thesis [here](https://uncertainty-for-engineers.github.io/uncertainty-modelling-for-engineers).
