title: OpenCossan Interval Predictor Model Toolbox
date: 2018-10-05
description: Some info on how to get started with IPMs (copied from my old site)

The Interval Predictor Model toolbox is now under internal alpha testing. We have implemented a wide variety of features from several papers. We plan to release the toolbox into the OpenCossan repository to coincide with [COSSANTHON2018](https://cossan.co.uk/cossanthon2018/index.php). In the meantime, if you would like to test the toolbox please send an email to me.

A limited functionality python version of the toolbox is available on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/JCSadeghi/PyIPM).

If you find the toolbox useful for your research and decide to use it in a paper we kindly request that you cite the following paper:

In addition, an interesting use case for the toolbox is available here:
